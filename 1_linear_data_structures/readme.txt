Python-specific linear data structures
--------------------------------------
- List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members. Uses square brackets.
- Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members. Tuple type requires comma for one or more elements, with parenthesis being optional in many contexts.
- Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members. Uses curly braces.
- Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members. Dictionary is based on key-value pairs. Uses curly braces.

*Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove and/or add items whenever you like.
**As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.
